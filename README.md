# Pricing_project
**Author** : ELKADDOURI MEHDI

### Summary  

Within the framework of this project, we will exploit the formula of black and scholes to price the call and the put during times and at maturity.   Similarly, we will use the simulation of Mont-carlo to price the European, asian,barrier calls and puts.  

On the other hand, we'll price the implied volatility using market data. For the stochastic volatility, we will use Heston model

***my_pricing*** : it's module that aims to price the data.  
***payoff*** : it calculates *the payoff* of differents products ( used in montecarlo simulation)

 *each code is commented to make the user understand its functionnality*
